To-do list web application programmed using React, intent on retooling it in the future as I understand React more<br>

Functionality is rather basic but is as follows:<br>
- Add tasks via user input<br>
- Read that list of tasks<br>
- Mark tasks as completed<br>
- Edit tasks as necessary<br>
- Delete tasks<br>
- View specific groupings of tasks
